# Automated-Drive-Thru-Ordering-System
An automated system for ordering at a restaurant drive thru.

The system uses a wake word ("alexa") to start listening. Once the wake word is spoken, the system will prompt the user to place their order. The user's order is converted from speech to text and is passed to the OpenAI api along with the menu and the prices. The system will return a receipt of the order along with the prices and total for the user and it will also speak out the receipt.
